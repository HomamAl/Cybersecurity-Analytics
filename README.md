In this repo I'm using R studio to analyse some intrusions using (K-means clustering) 
___

-	K-Means is a partition-based clustering algorithm commonly used in intrusion detection because it provides transparent analysis of clustered data.

-	K-Means groups the data into k groups (clusters) based on a similarity measure. Based on the features, it iteratively assigns points to each cluster so that each point is similar to those within the cluster and dissimilar to those outside the cluster.

-	K-Means outputs:

** The centroids (center points) of each cluster.
** The clustering assignments where each point is assigned to exactly one cluster.
